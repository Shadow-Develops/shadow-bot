# Shadow Bot
Shadow Bot is a multi-purpose Discord bot built to in Discord JS v13.
# Repo Information
This repo is here to make the Shadow Bot code/files open to the public since it has been depercated by Shadow Development. All the content is completely free to use however you like. It would be appriciated if credit was noted if you use major parts of the bot; however, it is not nessisary.
Using the [issues tab](https://github.com/Shadow-Develops/shadow-bot/issues) is welcome, but bear in mind the following:
> All issues raised may be read by either the community (most likely) or Shadow Development Staff. The community is more the welcome to help each other, provide fixes, etc. If we (Shadow Development) notice any quality fixed from the community or repeated issue fixes then we will add them to the repo.
### Merge requests
> Please make merge requests if you wish with common bugs and we will review them here and there.
Again, this project is no longer a priority, so it is here for the community to take and use as the wish. If merge requests are made will review them when we can.
### Updated Forks
> If we notice or get comments regarding someone that has forked the repo and mains it then we will link their fork and likely add them to this repo to maintain it at their leisure.
